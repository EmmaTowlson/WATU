              "This program has taught me that we all have the capacity to lead in our own ways. For some people visible leadership seems to come naturally. However, I have learnt that if we look to the values that we hold dearly, we can find our own ways to act for the greater good. This could be as a first follower or by working as a collaborator to help others also working for the greater good realise their leadership potential. This program has taught me that we need to understand ourselves first, our strengths and weaknesses and keep building our skills before we can become a good leader or truly lead in our own way for the greater good.
In my workplace (working for government) leadership has always been modelled as hierarchal with those at the top more concerned with self-promotion and control and management of resources of which people are just one. We are even called human resources and moved around the department like chess pieces by those above and our leadership model is self-perpetuating and the opposite of collaboration and creating leadership within a team. This program models a completely new way to look at leadership as a flattened structure and promoting collaboration and legacy as the mindset. Since doing this course it has become so clear that our current leaders lack the mind and skillset we need to act on things for the greater good. They are in those positions because they value very different things such as economical wealth and grandiose power. This is why action on the pandemic was so slow and similarly action on climate change as our leaders value economics and personal wealth so highly instead of the legacy of human and planet health. Afterwards they will continue to play the blame game to point the finger at others for this inaction but that wont stop the suffering they will and have caused through inaction on either.
The aha moment came when I understood the LSI and the need to put self first. As women and with a legacy mindset we always put that last and put it off – we have been trained in delayed gratification (work hard now for a degree later etc.) But if we put ourselves first and recognise we need to feed and protect that inner child as fiercely as we would our own children then we will have the strength to help others and this planet. Recognising when I go red or green is so important because it’s the way I have learnt to survive. If I come from a place of blue it is better for me and for everyone around me, my staff and my bosses. A true leader is someone who helps others become leaders."
