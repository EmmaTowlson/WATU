              "HB Aha Moments

A couple of things really….

4MAT/LSI learnings. Realising that I had historically pushed down any and all human emotions at work. I’d always kept work and my life as two separate doors, thinking this was the right thing to do to remain ‘professional’. But really this was hindering me being human, relatable and a respected and genuine leader. I needed to care more about my team and colleagues, be more human and have more coffee. This really hit me when we coloured in the LSI to show the leader we wanted, and that comparison. Being authentic can be achieved in both a work and personal environment, but it does require vulnerability, not listening to the internal monologue that runs 24/7 inside our heads. Understanding my weaknesses through honest and open feedback, has given me more focus on the areas I need to work on.

New Friends. With me always being so independent I've never needed to talk through things with people "I'll sort it out by myself" was my mantra. It took me a while to learn to trust these people, and that crying in front of others was actually ok. Having someone there who knows you, you trust, share stories and have a deep meaningful connection is something that will stay with me forever, and something I’ve never had before. This probably comes from being an engineer, but also I wouldn't have done created these relationships if I was in a hotel in Watford! There are more amazing women out there than you realise, and we each are capable of so much more.

Diary entry 10th December 2019 "Never have I felt so connected and so grounded than when I am with these women. It's like their brain just works exactly the same as mine, and we all understand the difficulties we have."…. 

I have a second family now. 
 
THEY INSPIRE ME."
